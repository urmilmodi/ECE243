This exercise is due to the week of Jan. 27, in your assigned Practical Session. Teaching Assistants will be provided in your lab session to record your progress and to help you with issues.

If you complete this exercise early, then you may wish to start working on Laboratory Exercise 2, which is due the next week and is an extension of this exercise. Lab 2 will require considerably more more time and effort than Lab 1.

The description of the exercise is given below, along with some design files that are provided for your use. You will need to unzip the design files and store them on your computer.
