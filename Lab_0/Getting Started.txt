You should do this lab exercise during the week of Jan 20, on your own time. There will no Teaching Assistants involved, and the lab won't be marked. But you should do the exercise on time so that you are ready for Labs 1 and 2, which follow.

Although this exercise should be fairly easy to perform, it provides an important introduction to the ModelSim simulation tool, and a re-introduction to the Quartus Prime software that you used in ECE241 (Digital Systems). The description of the exercise is given below, along with some design files that are provided for your use. You will need to unzip the design files and store them on your computer.
